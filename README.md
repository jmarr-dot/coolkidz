Filtering by tag and keyword gives many results. 
These results were returned on March 16, 2025. 
Note:
- Results may include articles and other media (e.g., podcasts)
- The results across keywords may be duplicated. 
- It is unclear why the tags with the same name give different results, 
there appears to be multiple types of tags. 
- These results appear to include articles not about the US; 
they may still all be published in the US.
